## README FILE FOR HOW RARE IS WEBSITE

I'll document the whole api and explain it in detail

**The API is highly experimental and in their own words -**

 All APIs should be considered experimental. There can be bugs! Use on your own risk! APIs should be considered alpha quality and going forward there will be breaking changes.
 Do not use as an oracle in DeFi applications


## Floor API ## 

{ Reminding this one more time: As we can't guarantee that this data is up to date and always accurate, do not use this API as an oracle for DeFi applications!
To retrieve Floor pricing for all NFT collections listed on HowRare.is use a GET request GET https://api.howrare.is/v0.1/floor }

** Calling this https://api.howrare.is/v0.1/floor returns all collections and we'll need to scrap the ones  **

Api Calling Example

import requests

url = "https://api.howrare.is/v0.1/floor"

response = requests.request("GET", url)

   print(response.text)
