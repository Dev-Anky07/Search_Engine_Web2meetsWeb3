##Readme File For Prototyping##

*not much activity is gonna be on here for a while as exams are comming up 2 weeks from now*

Figma UI Illustration File Included Below :-

I made this to prototype the UI for the search engine.

The Illustration shows If the user searches for 'Cool Cats', the search engine will show these results.
(Might change a lil bit in the future if I decide to add more features)

**I'm now gonna apply for some grants and if that doesn't work out well, I'll just crowd fund it or tie it to another NFT project for subsidising the project or Just apply for 'GITCOIN' funding while marketing it well and providing incentives for the backers**

Next step :-

Create a complete UI (Which people can interact with) by Figma Prototyping (interlinking different frames and adding logic like if clicked on -> do the desired action or if hovered over -> do this or that) and adding animations, and stuff to make it look awesome and easy to use as well.
