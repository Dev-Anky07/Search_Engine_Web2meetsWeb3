Intregates Both Web 2 and Web 3 Results (Like News and Blogs + NFT collections listings + Metadata + Images)

In short If you wanna research about a particular asset or even a collection, you can search for it in the following ways:

You can either search for a particular asset or a collection by its name or by its ID on web, Scour through multiple articles and loads of info on the web. Then check out its metadata (like Floor price, Owners etc etc) and images.

Or you could type in the collection name in our search engine and it will show you everything you need to know about that project and details surrounding it while also (giving you the option to buy it !?) removing irrelevent articles from the search results and filtering only the most relevent ones.

A search engine that combines all data from traditional and decentralized sources like web 2 and web 3 for a particular project and displays that information Graphically
